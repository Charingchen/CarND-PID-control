## PID Tuning
From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller)

Parameter|Rise time|Overshoot|Settling time|Steady-state error|Stability
---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------
K_p|	Decrease	|Increase|	Small change|	Decrease	|Degrade
K_i| Decrease	|Increase	|Increase	|Eliminate	|Degrade
K_d|	Minor change|	Decrease|	Decrease	|No effect in theory	|Improve if K_d small


### Twiddle logic
I am using a modified twiddle logic in this PID tuner. In order to achieve run twiddle only once every time gets the error readings, a state machine is used inside of for loop.
There are three state, INIT: Initialize best err and update pid values by adding dp values, INCREMENT: Increment dp if a better error found, vis versa, DECREMENT: if fail second times in a row, decrement dp with 0.9


However, I was first thinking to run this logic every time I got a cte from simulator. This fails because twiddle and PID controller would not react fast enough and result full left and right turns every step like following showed:

As the result, more errors need to be added together to feed into the twiddle. At beginning of the tuning, I used the average of the error to find a range of PID value and reach the values faster. Later when I have a value, I will use sum of all errors to feed into the twiddle. 
### Tuning Process 
Starting from  P=0,I=0,D=0 and stepping dp 1,1,1. After about 20 iteration of twiddle, I was able get PID value of P:2.5 I:0 D:10.

I was able to observe a lot of overshoot and  oscillation at a slight left turn. Like below 

![2.3-0.01-10](./images/2.3-0.01-10.gif)

Tuning down P and I to 0.5 and 0.0001 gives a better result. D is at 5.  However, after this I observed during a sharp turn, the car would oscillate. I decide to increase D to decrease overshoot and increase P a bit to reduce rise time.Then I run tiwddle with initial value of
`P= 0.531 I = 0.0001 D =9.6` 
![0.5-0.0001-9.6](./images/0.5-0.0001-9.6.gif)

After 7 iteration I found this final value:

Kp|Ki|Kd
---|---|---
0.8389|1.9e-5|10.6961

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.
